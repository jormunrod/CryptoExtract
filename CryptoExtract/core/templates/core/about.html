                <p>
                    CryptoExtract is a web application designed as a final project for the course
                    <strong>Acceso Inteligente a la Información</strong>. It provides a platform to scrape, index, and
                    analyze cryptocurrency data from
                    <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/markets/crypto/all/" target="_blank">Yahoo Finance</a>.

                <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                <p>
                    The project uses <strong>BeautifulSoup</strong> for web scraping to fetch real-time cryptocurrency
                    data. The data is then indexed
                    using <strong>Whoosh</strong>, allowing for fast and efficient querying and analysis. Users can
                    interact with the data through
                    various views and tools available on the platform.
